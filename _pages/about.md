I am actively studying solutions for On-Device Learning at AI System Research and Applications department of STMicroelectronics. My objective is to enable learning of AI models in resource-constrained tiny devices such as MCUs and sensors. Such research activity involves the quantiative analysis of alternative learning algorithms w.r.t bakcpropagation (e.g. Forward-Forward and PEPITA) and investigating models with low memory and computational complexity (e.g. hyperspherical classifiers). 

At the same time, I am successfully pursuing a Bachelor degree in Electronics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. As such, I am currently exploring on my own neuromorphic computing and other Post-Moore computing paradigms.

Over the last years, I have tutored several students for admission exams to engineering and economics universities, high-school tests and university courses.
